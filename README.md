[Global Android Dev Camp](http://gadc.io/2014) is back! It is a global event where developers come together to hack on Android apps. In 2012 over 50 cities participated.
This year Berlin will again be among them. Join us to create awesome things in just 48 hours.

The main topics are:
- Wearables
- Productive Android

But you are also more than welcome to join if you just want to hack on your favorite open source project or do something that doesn't fit into these categories.

Please sign up on our [Google+ event page](https://plus.google.com/events/cb9g72bhpd89nrmksjrn9a5msok)!
